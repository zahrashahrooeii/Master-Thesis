## Abstract
The project introduces a Python-based simulation framework designed for IoT-driven smart device automation. It encompasses:
- **Virtual sensors**: Temperature, humidity, and motion.
- **Control logic**: Actuator management (fans, lights) based on sensor thresholds.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Interactive Flask-based web application with real-time data display.

This thesis significantly contributes to developing a robust simulation framework supporting real-time control, interactive visualization, and advanced security mechanisms for IoT applications. It lays the groundwork for further exploration into machine learning integration and practical IoT deployments.
